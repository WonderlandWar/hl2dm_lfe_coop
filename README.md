# hl2dm_lfe_coop

This is the repo the "Classic HL2DM Coop and Puzzles" server uses for its download server.

Most of these maps were NOT made by me.

The only maps made by me or contributed to are:
* bk_coop_simulation_00
* bk_coop_simulation_01
* mm_coop_coastline
* mm_coop_facility
* mm_coop_facility2
* mm_coop_leftover
* mm_coop_powerhouse
* mm_coop_rebels_vs_combine
* mm_coop_rebels_vs_combine_part2

All other maps were modified by me to be playable in Lambda Fortress. The map creators are credited within the maps themselves.
I've also been trying to contact the creators of the maps to see if it's ok with them that I make their maps playable. Most of them haven't responded, sadly.
